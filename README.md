Barter Hub will be an online localized bartering service that will provide users the ability to trade goods and services within their community. Goods can range from any household items, produce, or anything sellable. Users will have account profiles that will contain simple user details such as their name, email, location, an inventory of items / services, and other details should they choose to disclose. 

Every user will have a specific inventory where they can list all their available goods and services that other users can peruse. Barter Hub will be monetized with advertisements and / or user fees. There will be a basic free option and a premium option that will give access to different features depending on the account type they choose. We envision this website to only allow bartering with no ability to use monetary currencies.
