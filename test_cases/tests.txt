Users should be allowed to delete their account clearing their information from our database, all the information of the specific user should not be found including all their past listings, transactions, etc.

Feature to Test: Storefront

The user will search for a given item by keyword with tags optional. The user will see the storefront loaded with items that match that keyword sorted by date posted
Once the user enters a keyword and presses search, a query will be sent to the database for all items that include that keyword (and possible tags) within the title or description of the item and will send back the query result to be displayed on the storefront

More information about the item will pop up in a modal, including the full-length description, categories, and the general location of the item.

Upon clicking “add new item,” a model should appear with a form. The user should be able to enter text into the text boxes and upload an image file for their item. When they submit the info form, a new card should be generated with the information they submitted. The card should appear on the inventory screen and a new item should be added to the “inventory” table of the database.
